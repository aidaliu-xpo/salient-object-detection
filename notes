parameters in a neural network are any numbers the model learn during training, like weights and biases

1.Preprocessing (resize_images.py)
*Resize raw images & masks once and save them
Use it before training
We use it to make data small, clean, and consistent for the model

2. Debug Data (debug_data.py)
Quickly check ONE image + mask to verify resizing, mask binariztion, and correctness
Use it before building the model

3. Dataloader (data_loader.py)
Load the seized dataset, convert to tensors, normalize, binarisze mask, and return batches
Use it during every training step
Role:Actual ML pipeline input

pipeline -- the sequence of steps your data goes through, form raw images -> to model training -> to final predicitons

#ConvBlock

This block does one thing, apply a 3x3 convolution + ReLU.
